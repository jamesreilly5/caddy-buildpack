# Heroku Buildpack: Caddy

This is a Heroku Buildpack for Caddy Server.

## Getting Started

Include a Caddyfile in your repo.

Include static files in your repo.

Set your buildpack to

`heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/nlozovan/caddy-buildpack-heroku.git`

Profit.

Based on this previously created buildpack: https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/fishman/buildpack-caddy . Credits should go to that owner.
